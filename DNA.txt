Create a function called complement(sequence).
create a dictionary called DNA2 that equals A,T,G,C.
Then use a for loop to loop thru the dictionary DNA2.
If sequence equals "A" use .replace() to replace "A" with "T"
iterate the same if statement with an elif statement the corresponding letters.
Then use a return statement to return sequence
Make a comment that says #driver code and create a variable called user that 
will take input from the user using input() to ask for the DNA sequence to change.
last call your complement() funtion.
